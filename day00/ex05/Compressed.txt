4:10 How was it @J reckoned? @ he was in circumcision, or in

4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the

4:13 For the promise, @ he @M be the heir of the @Ê, was not

7:8 But sin, ta@ occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all

7:10 And the commandment, @	 was ordained to @â, I @¢ to be

7:11 For sin, ta@ occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by

7:12 Wherefore the law is @Ç, and the commandment @Ç, and just,

7:13 Was @J @ @	 is @V @% @´ @ me? God forbid. But
sin, @ it @Ä appear sin, @öing @´ in me by @ @	 is

7:21 I find @J a law, @, @ I @ê do @V, @d is pre@Y

7:22 For I delight in the law of God @. the inward man: 7:23 But I

8:1 There is @I now no condemnation to @ @	 are in @j

8:2 For the law of the Spirit of @â in @j @8 @ @% me

8:3 For @\ the law could not do, in @ it was weak @á the

8:5 For @ @ are @. the @ô do mind the @, of the @ô;

8:6 For to be carnally minded is @´; but to be @ƒually minded

8:7 Be@“ the carnal mind is enmity @" God: for it is not

8:8 So @J @ @ are in the @ô cannot please God.

8:9 But ye are not in the @ô, but in the Spirit, if so be @ the

8:10 And if @j be in you, the body is @± @4 of sin; but the

8:12 @î, @l, we are debtors, not to the @ô, to live
@. the @ô.

8:13 For if ye live @. the @ô, ye @ die: but if ye @á

8:14 For as @s as are led by the Spirit of God, @ are the @/ of

8:15 For ye @ not received the @ƒ of bondage @^ to @¿; but

8:16 The Spirit itself beareth witness @ our @ƒ, @ we are

8:18 For I reckon @ the sufferings of @ pre@Y @b are not

8:19 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the

8:20 For the creature was @% subject to vanity, not @ingly, but

8:22 For we @R @ the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in

8:23 And not only @, but ourselves @!, @	 @ the @ïfruits
of the Spirit, @) we ourselves groan @in ourselves, waiting for
the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.

8:24 For we are saved by hope: but hope @ is seen is not hope: for
@\ a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?  8:25 But if we hope for
@ we see not, @J do we @ patience wait for it.

8:26 Likewise the Spirit @! helpeth our infirmities: for we @R not

8:27 And he @ searcheth the @Es @Reth @\ is the mind of the

8:28 And we @R @ all @, @ö @{ for @V to @ @

11:6 And if by grace, @J is it no @X of @ös: @Ñwise grace is
no @X grace. But if it be of @ös, @J it is no @X grace:
@Ñwise @ö is no @X @ö.

11:7 @» @J? @ @ not obtained @ @	 he seeketh for;
but the election @ obtained it, and the rest @ blinded.

11:8 (According as it is written, God @ @y @ the @ƒ of

11:9 And @1 @*, Let @ table be @% a snare, and a trap, and
a stumblingblock, and a recompence @ @: 11:10 Let @ @w be

11:11 I say @J, Have @ stumbled @ @ @M fall? God
forbid: but rather @á @ fall salvation is @ @ the
Gentiles, for to provoke @ to jealousy.

11:12 Now if the fall of @ be the riches of the @Ê, and the
diminishing of @ the riches of the Gentiles; how much @X @
fulness?  11:13 For I @è to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the
apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify @a office: 11:14 If by any means
I may provoke to emulation @ @	 are my @ô, and @Ä save
some of @.

11:15 For if the @|ing @< of @ be the reconciling of the @Ê,
@\ @ the receiving of @ be, but @â @ the @±?  11:16
For if the @ïfruit be @Ç, the lump is @! @Ç: and if the root
be @Ç, so are the branches.

11:17 And if some of the branches be broken off, and @, being a
wild olive tree, wert graffed in @> @, and @ @ par@Ust
of the root and fatness of the olive tree; 11:18 Boast not @" the

@.

11:19 @h wilt say @J, The branches @ broken off, @ I @Ä
be graffed in.

11:20 Well; @4 of unbelief @ @ broken off, and @
standest by faith. Be not @®minded, but @¿: 11:21 For if God
spared not the natural branches, @U heed lest he @! spare not
@.

11:22 @e @I the @Vness and s@Åity of God: on @ @	
fell, s@Åity; but @º @, @Vness, if @ continue in his

11:23 And @ @!, if @ abide not still in unbelief, @ be
graffed in: for God is able to graff @ in @^.

11:24 For if @ wert cut out of the olive tree @	 is wild by
nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature @ a @V olive tree:
how much @X @ @6, @	 be the natural branches, be graffed
@ @ own olive tree?  11:25 For I @ê not, @l, @ ye
@M be ignorant of @ mystery, lest ye @M be wise in @ own

11:26 And so all @ @ be saved: as it is written, There @
@ out of Sion the Deliverer, and @ turn @< ungodliness @

11:28 As concerning the gospel, @ are enemies for @ sakes: but
as touching the election, @ are be@ÿd for the @C's sakes.

11:29 For the gifts and calling of God are @õ repentance.

11:30 For as ye in @bs past @ not believed God, yet @ now
obtained mercy @á @ unbelief: 11:31 Even so @ @6 @!

11:32 For God @ concluded @ all in unbelief, @ he @Ä @

11:33 O the depth of the riches @∂ of the wisdom and @Rledge of
God!  how unsearchable are his @ﬂs, and his ways past finding
out!  11:34 For who @ @Rn the mind of the @0? or who @ @À

12:1 I beseech you @I, @l, by the mercies of God, @ ye

12:4 For as we @ @s members in one body, and all members @ not

12:6 Having @J gifts differing @N to the grace @ is @y

12:19 Dearly be@ÿd, avenge not @selves, but rather @K @T

12:20 @î if @; enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, @K

13:2 Whoso@Å @I resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance

13:3 For rulers are not a terror to @V @ös, but to the @d. Wilt

13:5 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but @!

13:6 For for @ @“ pay ye tribute @!: for @ are God's

13:13 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and

13:14 But put ye on the @0 @8 @j, and @3 not provision for

14:1 Him @ is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful

14:3 Let not him @ eateth despise him @ eateth not; and let not

14:4 Who art @ @ judgest @à man's @x? to his own

14:5 One man esteemeth one day above @à: @à esteemeth @+

14:6 He @ regardeth the day, regardeth it @ the @0; and he

14:7 For @ª of us liveth to @t, and no man dieth to @t.

14:8 For whether we live, we live @ the @0; and whether we die,
we die @ the @0: whether we live @I, or die, we are the

14:9 For to @ end @j @∂ died, and rose, and revived, @ he

14:10 But why dost @ judge thy @§? or why dost @ set at

14:11 For it is written, As I live, @* the @0, @+ knee @

14:15 But if thy @§ be grieved @ thy @Â, now walkest @

14:16 Let not @J @ @V be @d spoken of: 14:17 For the @æ

15:1 We @J @ are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the

15:2 Let @+ one of us please his neighbour for his @V to

15:3 For @) @j pleased not @t; but, as it is written, The

2:3 And I was @ you in weakness, and in @¿, and in much

2:4 And my speech and my preaching was not @ enticing @o of

2:6 Howbeit we @è wisdom @> @ @ are perfect: yet not the

2:11 For @\ man @Reth the @, of a man, save the @ƒ of man

2:12 Now we @ received, not the @ƒ of the @Ê, but the @ƒ

2:13 Which @, @! we @è, not in the @o @	 man's wisdom

2:14 But the natural man receiveth not the @, of the Spirit of

2:15 But he @ is @ƒual judgeth all @,, yet he @t is

2:16 For who @ @Rn the mind of the @0, @ he may instruct

3:1 And I, @l, could not @è @ you as @ @ƒual, but

3:2 I @ fed you @ milk, and not @ @Â: for hitherto ye @

3:3 For ye are yet carnal: for @Œas @ is @> you envying, and

while one @*, I am of Paul; and @à, I am of Apollos; are ye

3:7 So @J @L is he @ planteth any @q, @L he @

3:8 Now he @ planteth and he @ @¶eth are one: and @+ man

3:9 For we are labourers @{ @ God: ye are God's husbandry, ye

3:10 According to the grace of God @	 is @y @ me, as a wise

3:11 For @Ñ @¢ation can no man lay @} @ is laid, @	 is

3:12 Now if any man build @ @ @¢ation @ú, @’, precious

3:18 Let no man deceive @t. If any man @> you seemeth to be

3:19 For the wisdom of @ @Ê is foolishness @ God. For it is

3:20 And @^, The @0 @Reth the @ghts of the wise, @ @

3:21 @î let no man @• in men. For all @, are @'s;

4:1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of @j, and

4:2 More@5 it is required in stewards, @ a man be @¢ faithful.

4:3 But @ me it is a very small @q @ I @M be judged of

4:6 And @6 @,, @l, I @ in a figure transferred to

4:9 For I think @ God @ set @? us the apostles last, as it

4:10 We are fools for @j's sake, but ye are wise in @j; we are

4:14 I write not @6 @, to shame you, but as my be@ÿd @/ I

4:15 For @gh ye @ ten @u instructers in @j, yet @

4:21 @» @ ye? @ I @ @ you @ a rod, or in @ÿ, and

5:9 I wrote @ you in an epistle not to company @ fornicators:

5:11 But now I @ written @ you not to @¡ company, if any man

5:12 For @\ @ I to do to judge @ @! @ are @õ? do not

6:1 Dare any of you, having a matter @" @à, go to law @

6:4 If @J ye @ @ﬂs of @, pertaining to @ @â, set

6:5 I @è to @ shame. Is it so, @ @ is not a wise man

6:7 Now @I @ is utterly a fault @> you, @4 ye go to

6:9 Know ye not @ the un@≥eous @ not inherit the @æ of

6:11 And such @ some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are
sanctified, but ye are justified in the @9 of the @0 @8, and by
the Spirit of our God.

6:12 All @, are lawful @ me, but all @, are not expedient:
all @, are lawful for me, but I @ not be @B @ß the

6:13 Meats for the belly, and the belly for @Âs: but God @
destroy @∂ it and @. Now the body is not for fornication, but for

6:14 And God @ @∂ raised up the @0, and @ @! raise up us
by his own power.

6:15 Know ye not @ @ bodies are the members of @j? @ I
@J @U the members of @j, and @3 @ the members of an

6:16 @»? @R ye not @ he @	 is joined to an harlot is one

6:17 But he @ is joined @ the @0 is one @ƒ.

6:18 Flee fornication. Every sin @ a man doeth is @õ the body;
but he @ committeth fornication sinneth @" his own body.

6:19 @»? @R ye not @ @ body is the temple of the Holy Ghost

For ye are bought @ a price: @I glorify God in @ body,
and in @ @ƒ, @	 are God's.

7:1 Now concerning the @, @Œof ye wrote @ me: It is @V for
a man not to touch a @µ.

7:2 N@Åtheless, to avoid fornication, let @+ man @ his own
@ü, and let @+ @µ @ her own husband.

7:3 Let the husband render @ the @ü due benevolence: and @[wise
@! the @ü @ the husband.

7:4 The @ü @ not power of her own body, but the husband: and
@[wise @! the husband @ not power of his own body, but the

7:5 Defraud ye not one the @Ñ, except it be @ con@Y for a

@{ @^, @ Satan tempt you not for @ incontinency.

7:6 But I @è @ by permission, and not of commandment.

7:7 For I @ê @ all men @ @) as I myself. But @+ man @
his proper gift of God, one @. @ manner, and @à @. @.

7:8 I say @I to the unmarried and widows, It is @V for @
if @ abide @) as I.

7:9 But if @ cannot contain, let @ marry: for it is better to
marry @} to burn.

7:10 And @ the married I command, yet not I, but the @0, Let not
the @ü depart @ her husband: 7:11 But and if she depart, let her
remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the
husband put @< his @ü.

7:12 But to the rest @è I, not the @0: If any @§ @ a @ü
@ believeth not, and she be pleased to @≈ @ him, let him not
put her @<.

7:13 And the @µ @	 @ an husband @ believeth not, and if he
be pleased to @≈ @ her, let her not leave him.

7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the @ü, and the
unbelieving @ü is sanctified by the husband: else @ @ @
unclean; but now are @ @Ç.

7:15 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A @§ or a
sister is not @ß bondage in such cases: but God @ @` us to
@°.

7:16 For @\ @Rest @, O @ü, whether @ @# save thy
husband?  or how @Rest @, O man, whether @ @# save thy
@ü?  7:17 But as God @ distributed to @+ man, as the @0 @
@` @+ one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.

7:18 Is any man @` being circumcised? let him not be@
uncircumcised. Is any @` in uncircumcision? let him not be
circumcised.

7:19 Circumcision is no@q, and uncircumcision is no@q, but the
@¡ing of the commandments of God.

7:20 Let @+ man abide in the @  calling @Œin he was @`.

7:21 Art @ @` being a @x? care not for it: but if @
mayest be @% free, use it rather.

7:22 For he @ is @` in the @0, being a @x, is the @0's
freeman: @[wise @! he @ is @`, being free, is @j's
@x.

7:23 Ye are bought @ a price; be not ye the @ of men.

7:24 Brethren, let @+ man, @Œin he is @`, @in abide @
God.

7:25 Now concerning virgins I @ no commandment of the @0: yet I
@K my @ﬂ, as one @ @ obtained mercy of the @0 to be

7:26 I suppose @I @ @ is @V for the pre@Y distress, I
say, @ it is @V for a man so to be.

7:27 Art @ bound @ a @ü? seek not to be loosed. Art @
loosed @ a @ü? seek not a @ü.

7:28 But and if @ marry, @ @2 not sinned; and if a virgin
marry, she @ not sinned. N@Åtheless such @ @ trouble in
the @ô: but I spare you.

7:29 But @ I say, @l, the @b is short: it remaineth, @
@∂ @ @ @ wives be as @gh @ had @ª; 7:30 And @
@ weep, as @gh @ wept not; and @ @ rejoice, as @gh

7:31 And @ @ use @ @Ê, as not abusing it: for the fashion
of @ @Ê @Feth @<.

7:32 But I @ê @ you @õ carefulness. He @ is unmarried
careth for the @, @ belong to the @0, how he may please the
@0: 7:33 But he @ is married careth for the @, @ are of
the @Ê, how he may please his @ü.

7:34 There is difference @! between a @ü and a virgin. The
unmarried @µ careth for the @, of the @0, @ she may be
@Ç @∂ in body and in @ƒ: but she @ is married careth for
the @, of the @Ê, how she may please her husband.

7:35 And @ I @è for @ own profit; not @ I may @| a snare
@ you, but for @ @	 is @ly, and @ ye may attend @
the @0 @õ distraction.

7:36 But if any man think @ he be@th @t un@ly @º his
virgin, if she @F the flower of her age, and need so require, let
him do @\ he @, he sinneth not: let @ marry.

7:37 N@Åtheless he @ standeth stedfast in his @E, having no
necessity, but @ power @5 his own @, and @ so decreed in
his @E @ he @ @¡ his virgin, doeth well.

7:38 So @J he @ @Kth her in marriage doeth well; but he @
@Kth her not in marriage doeth better.

7:39 The @ü is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but
if her husband be @±, she is at liberty to be married to @P she
@; only in the @0.

7:40 But she is happier if she so abide, @. my @ﬂ: and I
think @! @ I @ the Spirit of God.

8:1 Now as touching @, offered @ idols, we @R @ we all
@ @Rledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.

8:2 And if any man think @ he @Reth any @q, he @Reth no@q
yet as he ought to @R.

8:3 But if any man @ÿ God, the @  is @Rn of him.

8:4 As concerning @I the eating of @é @, @ are

8:5 For @gh @ be @ are @` gods, whether in @i or in

8:7 Howbeit @ is not in @+ man @ @Rledge: for some @

8:8 But @Â commendeth us not to God: for @L, if we eat, are we

8:9 But @U heed lest by any means @ liberty of @'s be@ a

8:10 For if any man see @ @	 @2 @Rledge sit at @Â in the

@á thy @Rledge @ the weak @§ perish, for @P @j

8:13 Wherefore, if @Â @3 my @§ to offend, I @ eat no @ô

9:1 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? @ I not seen @8 @j

10:16 The cup of blessing @	 we bless, is it not the communion of

10:22 Do we provoke the @0 to jealousy? are we stronger @} he?
10:23 All @, are lawful for me, but all @, are not expedient:

11:1 Be ye followers of me, @) as I @! am of @j.

11:6 For if the @µ be not c@5ed, let her @! be shorn: but if it
be a shame for a @µ to be shorn or s@n, let her be c@5ed.

11:7 For a man indeed ought not to c@5 his @∞, forasmuch as he is

11:8 For the man is not of the @µ: but the @µ of the man.

11:9 Neither was the man created for the @µ; but the @µ for the

11:10 For @ @“ ought the @µ to @ power on her @∞ @4

11:11 N@Åtheless @L is the man @õ the @µ, @L the

11:12 For as the @µ is of the man, @) so is the man @! by the

11:13 Judge in @selves: is it @ly @ a @µ @⁄ @ God

11:16 But if any man seem to be contentious, we @ no such custom,

11:17 Now in @ @ I declare @ you I praise you not, @ ye

11:18 For @ï of all, @ ye @ @{ in the church, I @ì

11:20 @∏ ye @ @{ @I @ one @T, @ is not to

11:22 @»? @ ye not @s to eat and to @≤ in? or despise ye

11:27 Wherefore whoso@Å @ eat @ @¥, and @≤ @ cup of

11:28 But let a man exa@a @t, and so let him eat of @ @¥,

11:29 For he @ eateth and @≤eth unworthily, eateth and @≤eth

11:30 For @ @“ @s are weak and sickly @> you, and @s

11:31 For if we @ê judge ourselves, we @M not be judged.

11:32 But @ we are judged, we are c@2ened of the @0, @ we

11:33 Wherefore, my @l, @ ye @ @{ to eat, tarry one

11:34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; @ ye @ not

12:1 Now concerning @ƒual gifts, @l, I @ê not @ you

12:2 Ye @R @ ye @ Gentiles, carried @< @ @6 dumb

12:3 Wherefore I @K you to @ßstand, @ no man @èing by the
Spirit of God calleth @8 accursed: and @ no man can say @
@8 is the @0, but by the Holy Ghost.

12:4 Now @ are diversities of gifts, but the @  Spirit.

12:5 And @ are differences of administrations, but the @  @0.

12:6 And @ are diversities of operations, but it is the @  God
@	 @öeth all in all.

12:7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is @y to @+ man to
profit @al.

12:8 For to one is @y by the Spirit the @W of wisdom; to @à
the @W of @Rledge by the @  Spirit; 12:9 To @à faith by the
@  Spirit; to @à the gifts of healing by the @  Spirit; 12:10
To @à the @öing of miracles; to @à prophecy; to @à
discerning of @ƒs; to @à divers kinds of tongues; to @à
the interpretation of tongues: 12:11 But all @6 @öeth @ one
and the self@  Spirit, dividing to @+ man s@Åally as he @.

12:12 For as the body is one, and @ @s members, and all the
members of @ one body, being @s, are one body: so @! is @j.

12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized @ one body, whether we
be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and @ @À all
@% to @≤ @ one Spirit.

12:14 For the body is not one member, but @s.

12:15 If the foot @ say, Be@“ I am not the @$, I am not of
the body; is it @I not of the body?  12:16 And if the ear @
say, Be@“ I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it @I
not of the body?  12:17 If the whole body @ an eye, @Œ @ the
@ìing? If the whole @ @ìing, @Œ @ the smelling?  12:18
But now @ God set the members @+ one of @ in the body, as it
@ pleased him.

12:19 And if @ @ all one member, @Œ @ the body?  12:20 But
now are @ @s members, yet but one body.

12:21 And the eye cannot say @ the @$, I @ no need of @:
nor @^ the @∞ to the feet, I @ no need of you.

12:22 Nay, much @X @é members of the body, @	 seem to be @X
feeble, are necessary: 12:23 And @é members of the body, @	 we
think to be less honourable, @ @6 we bestow @X abundant
honour; and our un@ly parts @ @X abundant @liness.

12:24 For our @ly parts @ no need: but God @ tempered the

lacked.

12:25 @« @ @M be no schism in the body; but @ the members
@M @ the @  care one for @à.

12:26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer @ it;
or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice @ it.

12:27 Now ye are the body of @j, and members in particular.

12:28 And God @ set some in the church, @ï apostles, secondarily
prophets, thirdly teachers, @. @ miracles, @J gifts of
healings, helps, g@5nments, diversities of tongues.

12:29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all
@öers of miracles?  12:30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all
@è @ tongues? do all interpret?  12:31 But covet earnestly the
best gifts: and yet shew I @ you a @X excellent way.

13:1 @hgh I @è @ the tongues of men and of angels, and @
not charity, I am be@ as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

13:2 And @gh I @ the gift of prophecy, and @ßstand all

could remove mountains, and @ not charity, I am no@q.

13:3 And @gh I bestow all my @Vs to feed the poor, and @gh I
@K my body to be burned, and @ not charity, it profiteth me
no@q.

13:4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity
vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 13:5 Doth not be@ itself
unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no
@d; 13:6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 13:7
Beareth all @,, believeth all @,, hopeth all @,, endureth
all @,.

13:8 Charity n@Å faileth: but whether @ be prophecies, @
@ fail; whether @ be tongues, @ @ cease; whether @
be @Rledge, it @ vanish @<.

13:9 For we @R in part, and we prophesy in part.

13:10 But @ @ @	 is perfect is @, @J @ @	 is in

13:11 @∏ I was a child, I @g as a child, I @ß@¬ as a child,
I @ght as a child: but @ I be@ a man, I put @< childish
@,.

13:12 For now we see @á a glass, darkly; but @J @ù to @ù:
now I @R in part; but @J @ I @R @) as @! I am @Rn.

13:13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, @6 @~; but the
@:est of @6 is charity.

14:1 Follow @. charity, and desire @ƒual gifts, but rather @
ye may prophesy.

14:2 For he @ @èeth in an un@Rn tongue @èeth not @ men,
but @ God: for no man @ßstandeth him; howbeit in the @ƒ he
@èeth mysteries.

14:3 But he @ prophesieth @èeth @ men to edification, and
exhortation, and comfort.

14:4 He @ @èeth in an un@Rn tongue edifieth @t; but he

14:5 I @ê @ ye all @g @ tongues but rather @ ye

14:6 Now, @l, if I @ @ you @èing @ tongues, @\
@ I profit you, except I @ @è to you either by revelation,

14:10 There are, it may be, so @s kinds of @vs in the @Ê, and

14:11 @î if I @R not the meaning of the @v, I @ be

14:12 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of @ƒual gifts, seek
@ ye may excel to the edifying of the church.

14:13 Wherefore let him @ @èeth in an un@Rn tongue @⁄ @

14:14 For if I @⁄ in an un@Rn tongue, my @ƒ @⁄eth, but my

14:15 @» is it @J? I @ @⁄ @ the @ƒ, and I @ @⁄

14:18 I @}k my God, I @è @ tongues @X @} ye all: 14:19 Yet

14:20 Brethren, be not @ in @ßstanding: howbeit in malice be

14:21 In the law it is written, With men of @Ñ tongues and @Ñ

14:22 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to @ @ believe, but

14:23 If @I the whole church be @ @{ @ one @T,

14:26 How is it @J, @l? @ ye @ @{, @+ one of

14:29 Let the prophets @è two or @~, and let the @Ñ judge.

14:30 If any @q be revealed to @à @ sitteth by, let the

14:32 And the @ƒs of the prophets are subject to the prophets.

14:33 For God is not the author of confusion, but of @°, as in all

14:34 Let @ women @¡ silence in the churches: for it is not

sowest not @ body @ @ be, but bare grain, it may chance of
wheat, or of some @Ñ grain: 15:38 But God @Kth it a body as it
@ pleased him, and to @+ seed his own body.

15:39 All @ô is not the @  @ô: but @ is one kind of @ô
of men, @à @ô of beasts, @à of fishes, and @à of
birds.

15:40 There are @! celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the
@• of the celestial is one, and the @• of the terrestrial is
@à.

15:41 There is one @• of the sun, and @à @• of the moon,
and @à @• of the stars: for one star differeth @ @à
star in @•.

15:42 So @! is the resurrection of the @±. It is sown in
corruption; it is raised in incorruption: 15:43 It is sown in
dishonour; it is raised in @•: it is sown in weakness; it is raised
in power: 15:44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a @ƒual
body. There is a natural body, and @ is a @ƒual body.

15:45 And so it is written, The @ï man Adam was @% a living @Ü;
the last Adam was @% a quickening @ƒ.

15:46 Howbeit @ was not @ï @	 is @ƒual, but @ @	 is

15:47 The @ï man is of the @7, @7y; the second man is the

15:48 As is the @7y, such are @ @! @ are @7y: and as is

15:49 And as we @ borne the image of the @7y, we @ @! bear

15:50 Now @ I say, @l, @ @ô and @å cannot inherit

15:51 @e, I shew you a mystery; We @ not all sleep, but we

at the last trump: for the trumpet @ sound, and the @± @ be

15:53 For @ corruptible must put on incorruption, and @ mortal

15:54 So @ @ corruptible @ @ put on incorruption, and
@ mortal @ @ put on immortality, @J @ be @B to
@F the @' @ is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.

15:55 O @´, @Œ is thy sting? O grave, @Œ is thy victory?
15:56 The sting of @´ is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.

The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians


1:1 Paul, an apostle of @8 @j by the @ of God, and Timothy

1:3 Blessed be God, @) the Father of our @0 @8 @j, the

in all our tribulation, @ we may be able to comfort @ @	 are

God.

1:5 For as the sufferings of @j abound in us, so our consolation
@! aboundeth by @j.

1:6 And whether we be afflicted, it is for @ consolation and
salvation, @	 is effectual in the enduring of the @  sufferings
@	 we @! suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for @
consolation and salvation.

1:7 And our hope of you is stedfast, @Ring, @ as ye are par@Urs
of the sufferings, so @ ye be @! of the consolation.

1:8 For we @ê not, @l, @ you ignorant of our trouble @	
@ to us in Asia, @ we @ pressed out of measure, above
strength, insomuch @ we despaired @) of @â: 1:9 But we had the

1:12 For our rejoicing is @, the testimony of our conscience, @
in simpli@@ and godly sincerity, not @ @ôly wisdom, but by the

abundantly to you-ward.

1:13 For we write @ª @Ñ @, @ you, @} @\ ye read or

@! ye @ ac@Rledged us in part, @ we are @ rejoicing, @)

1:15 And in @ confidence I was minded to @ @ you @, @

1:17 @∏ I @I was @„ minded, did I use lightness? or the

1:19 For the Son of God, @8 @j, who was preached @> you by
us, @) by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in
him was yea.

1:20 For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, @
the @• of God by us.

1:21 Now he @	 stablisheth us @ you in @j, and @ anointed

1:23 More@5 I call God for a record @ my @Ü, @ to spare you

1:24 Not for @ we @ dominion @5 @ faith, but are helpers of

2:1 But I deter@ad @ @ myself, @ I @ê not @ @^ to

2:2 For if I @3 you sorry, who is he @J @ @3th me glad, but

2:4 For out of much affliction and anguish of @E I wrote @ you

2:5 But if any @ @“d grief, he @ not grieved me, but in part:
@ I may not @5charge you all.

2:6 Sufficient to such a man is @ punishment, @	 was inflicted
of @s.

2:7 So @ contrariwise ye ought rather to for@K him, and comfort
him, lest perhaps such a one @M be swallowed up @ @5much

2:8 Wherefore I beseech you @ ye @ê confirm @ @ÿ @º
him.

2:9 For to @ end @! did I write, @ I @Ä @R the proof of
you, whether ye be obedient in all @,.

2:10 To @P ye for@K any @q, I for@K @!: for if I for@É
any @q, to @P I for@É it, for @ sakes for@É I it in the
person of @j; 2:11 Lest Satan @M get an advantage of us: for
we are not ignorant of his devices.

2:12 Further@X, @ I @ to Troas to preach @j's gospel, and
a door was opened @ me of the @0, 2:13 I had no rest in my

2:14 Now @}ks be @ God, @	 always @“th us to triumph in

2:15 For we are @ God a sweet savour of @j, in @ @ are
saved, and in @ @ perish: 2:16 To the one we are the savour of
@´ @ @´; and to the @Ñ the savour of @â @ @â. And
who is sufficient for @6 @,?  2:17 For we are not as @s,
@	 corrupt the @W of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in
the @… of God @è we in @j.

3:1 Do we begin @^ to commend ourselves? or need we, as some
@Ñs, epistles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation
@ you?  3:2 Ye are our epistle written in our @Es, @Rn and
read of all men: 3:3 Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the
epistle of @j ministered by us, written not @ ink, but @ the
Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in @ôy tables
of the @E.

3:4 And such trust @ we @á @j to God-ward: 3:5 Not @ we
are sufficient of ourselves to think any @q as of ourselves; but
our sufficiency is of God; 3:6 Who @! @ @% us able ministers of
the new testament; not of the letter, but of the @ƒ: for the
letter killeth, but the @ƒ @Kth @â.

3:7 But if the ministration of @´, written and engraven in stones,
was glorious, so @ the @ of @ could not stedfastly
@Q the @ù of @D for the @• of his countenance; @	 @•
was to be @k @<: 3:8 How @ not the ministration of the @ƒ

@•, much @X doth the ministration of @€ exceed in
@•.

3:10 For @) @ @	 was @% glorious had no @• in @
respect, by reason of the @• @ excelleth.

3:11 For if @ @	 is @k @< was glorious, much @X @ @	
remaineth is glorious.

3:12 Seeing @J @ we @ such hope, we use @: plainness of
speech: 3:13 And not as @D, @	 put a vail @5 his @ù, @
the @ of @ could not stedfastly look to the end of @
@	 is abolished: 3:14 But @ minds @ blinded: for @∫ @

3:15 But @) @ @ day, @ @D is read, the vail is @

3:16 N@Åtheless @ it @ turn to the @0, the vail @ be

3:17 Now the @0 is @ Spirit: and @Œ the Spirit of the @0 is,
@ is liberty.

3:18 But we all, @ open @ù @Qing as in a glass the @• of

4:1 @î seeing we @ @ ministry, as we @ received mercy,
we faint not; 4:2 But @ renounced the hidden @, of dishonesty,
not wal@ in craftiness, nor @$ling the @W of God deceitfully;
but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to @+ man's
conscience in the @… of God.

4:3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to @ @ are lost: 4:4 In
@P the god of @ @Ê @ blinded the minds of @ @

4:5 For we preach not ourselves, but @j @8 the @0; and

4:6 For God, who @ë the light to shine out of darkness, @
shined in our @Es, to @K the light of the @Rledge of the @•

4:7 But we @ @ treasure in @7en vessels, @ the excellency
of the power may be of God, and not of us.

4:8 We are troubled on @+ @í, yet not distressed; we are

@-, but not destroyed; 4:10 Always bearing @_ in the body the

4:11 For we @	 live are alway @‰ @ @´ for @8' sake,

4:12 So @J @´ @öeth in us, but @â in you.

4:13 We having the @  @ƒ of faith, @N as it is written, I

4:16 For @	 @“ we faint not; but @gh our outward man perish,

4:17 For our light affliction, @	 is but for a moment, @öeth for
us a far @X exceeding and eternal weight of @•; 4:18 While we
look not at the @, @	 are seen, but at the @, @	 are not

5:1 For we @R @ if our @7ly @ of @ @œ @

5:2 For in @ we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed @ @

5:4 For we @ are in @ @œ do groan, being burdened: not

5:5 Now he @ @ wrought us for the self@  @q is God, who

5:6 @î we are always confident, @Ring @, whilst we are at

5:9 Wherefore we labour, @, whether pre@Y or ab@Y, we may be

5:10 For we must all appear @ the @ﬂ seat of @j; @

5:11 Knowing @I the terror of the @0, we persuade men; but we

5:12 For we commend not ourselves @^ @ you, but @K you

5:14 For the @ÿ of @j constraineth us; @4 we @„ judge,

7:16 I rejoice @I @ I @ confidence in you in all @,.

8:1 More@5, @l, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed
on the churches of Macedonia; 8:2 How @ in a @: trial of
affliction the abundance of @ joy and @ deep p@5ty abounded
@ the riches of @ liberality.

8:3 For to @ power, I bear record, yea, and beyond @ power
@ @ @ing of @û; 8:4 Praying us @ much intreaty
@ we @ê receive the gift, and @U @ us the fellowship of the
ministering to the saints.

8:5 And @ @ did, not as we hoped, but @ï @É @ own

8:6 Insomuch @ we desired Titus, @ as he had begun, so he @ê
@! finish in you the @  grace @!.

8:7 @î, as ye abound in @+ @q, in faith, and utterance,
and @Rledge, and in all diligence, and in @ @ÿ to us, see @
ye abound in @ grace @!.

8:8 I @è not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of
@Ñs, and to prove the sincerity of @ @ÿ.

8:9 For ye @R the grace of our @0 @8 @j, @, @gh he
was rich, yet for @ sakes he be@ poor, @ ye @á his
p@5ty @Ä be rich.

8:10 And herein I @K my advice: for @ is expedient for you, who
@ begun @, not only to do, but @! to be forward a @¨ ago.

8:11 Now @I perform the doing of it; @ as @ was a
readiness to @, so @ may be a performance @! out of @
@	 ye @.

8:12 For if @ be @ï a @ing mind, it is accepted @N to
@ a man @, and not @N to @ he @ not.

8:13 For I mean not @ @Ñ men be eased, and ye burdened: 8:14 But
by an equality, @ now at @ @b @ abundance may be a supply
for @ want, @ @ abundance @! may be a supply for @
want: @ @ may be equality: 8:15 As it is written, He @ had
ga@d much had no@q @5; and he @ had ga@d little had no
lack.

8:16 But @}ks be to God, @	 put the @  earnest care @ the
@E of Titus for you.

8:17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being @X forward,
of his own accord he @& @ you.

8:18 And we @ @Y @ him the @§, whose praise is in the
gospel @áout all the churches; 8:19 And not @ only, but who
was @! chosen of the churches to travel @ us @ @ grace,
@	 is administered by us to the @• of the @  @0, and

8:22 And we @ @Y @ @ our @§, @P we @ often@bs

8:23 Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and
fellowhelper concerning you: or our @l be enquired of, @ are
the messengers of the churches, and the @• of @j.

8:24 Wherefore shew ye to @, and @ the churches, the proof of
@ @ÿ, and of our boasting on @ behalf.

9:1 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous
for me to write to you: 9:2 For I @R the forwardness of @ mind,
for @	 I boast of you to @ of Macedonia, @ Achaia was ready a

9:3 Yet @ I @Y the @l, lest our boasting of you @M be

haply if @ of Macedonia @ @ me, and find you unprepared, we
(@ we say not, ye) @M be ashamed in @ @  confident
boasting.

9:5 @î I @ght it necessary to exhort the @l, @ @
@ê go @ @ you, and @3 up @@$ @ bounty, @Œof
ye had notice @, @ the @  @Ä be ready, as a matter of
bounty, and not as of covetousness.

9:6 But @ I say, He @	 soweth sparingly @ reap @!
sparingly; and he @	 soweth bountifully @ reap @!
bountifully.

9:7 Every man @N as he purposeth in his @E, so let him @K;
not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God @ÿth a cheerful @Kr.

9:8 And God is able to @3 all grace abound @º you; @ ye,
always having all sufficiency in all @,, may abound to @+ @V
@ö: 9:9 (As it is written, He @ dispersed abroad; he @ @y
to the poor: his @€ remaineth for @Å.

9:10 Now he @ ministereth seed to the sower @∂ minister @¥ for

9:12 For the administration of @ service not only supplieth the

9:15 Thanks be @ God for his un@èable gift.

10:1 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of

some, @	 think of us as if we walked @N to the @ô.

10:3 For @gh we walk in the @ô, we do not war @. the @ô:
10:4 (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but @Äy

10:7 Do ye look on @, @. the outward appearance? If any man

10:8 For @gh I @M boast some@\ @X of our authority, @	
the @0 @ @y us for edification, and not for @ destruction,
I @M not be ashamed: 10:9 @« I may not seem as if I @ê

10:10 For his letters, say @, are weighty and powerful; but his

10:11 Let such an one think @, @, such as we are in @W by
letters @ we are ab@Y, such @ we be @! in deed @ we are

10:12 For we dare not @3 ourselves of the number, or compare

are not wise.

10:13 But we @ not boast of @, @õ our measure, but

a measure to reach @) @ you.

10:14 For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as @gh we
reached not @ you: for we are @ as far as to you @! in
preaching the gospel of @j: 10:15 Not boasting of @, @õ
our measure, @ is, of @Ñ men's labours; but having hope, @
@ faith is increased, @ we @ be enlarged by you @N to

10:17 But he @ glorieth, let him @• in the @0.

10:18 For not he @ commendeth @t is approved, but @P the

11:1 Would to God ye could bear @ me a little in my folly: and

11:2 For I am jealous @5 you @ godly jealousy: for I @
espoused you to one husband, @ I may pre@Y you as a c@2e virgin

11:3 But I @¿, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve
@á his subtilty, so @ minds @M be corrupted @ the

11:4 For if he @ @th preacheth @à @8, @P we @ not

11:5 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.

11:6 But @gh I be rude in speech, yet not in @Rledge; but we @

11:7 Have I committed an offence in abasing myself @ ye @Ä be

11:8 I robbed @Ñ churches, ta@ wages of @, to do you service.

11:10 As the truth of @j is in me, no man @ stop me of @

11:11 Wherefore? @4 I @ÿ you not? God @Reth.

11:13 For such are false apostles, deceitful @öers, transforming

11:14 And no marvel; for Satan @t is transformed @ an angel of

11:15 @î it is no @: @q if his ministers @! be

12:12 Truly the signs of an apostle @ wrought @> you in all

1:9 As we @

1:10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men?
for if I yet pleased men, I @M not be the @x of @j.

1:11 But I certify you, @l, @ the gospel @	 was preached

1:12 For I @L received it of man, @L was I taught it, but by

1:15 But @ it pleased God, who separated me @ my @‘'s womb,

2:3 But @L Titus, who was @ me, being a Greek, was compelled

3:5 He @I @ ministereth to you the Spirit, and @öeth

3:8 And the scripture, foreseeing @ God @ê justify the hea@J

3:9 So @J @ @	 be of faith are blessed @ faithful Abraham.

3:10 For as @s as are of the @ös of the law are @ß the curse:

3:11 But @ no man is justified by the law in the @… of God, it

3:13 @j @ redeemed us @ the curse of the law, being @% a

3:15 Brethren, I @è @. the manner of men; @hgh it be but a

3:16 Now to Abraham and his seed @ the promises @%. He @* not,

3:17 And @ I say, @ the @‡, @ was confirmed @ of

cannot disannul, @ it @M @3 the promise of @ª effect.

3:18 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no @X of promise:
but God @É it to Abraham by promise.

3:19 Wherefore @J serveth the law? It was added @4 of
transgressions, till the seed @M @ to @P the promise was

3:20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.

3:21 Is the law @J @" the promises of God? God forbid: for if

3:22 But the scripture @ concluded all @ß sin, @ the promise

3:23 But @ faith @, we @ kept @ß the law, shut up @

3:24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to @Z us @ @j,

3:25 But @. @ faith is @, we are no longer @ß a

3:26 For ye are all the @ of God by faith in @j @8.

3:27 For as @s of you as @ @À baptized @ @j @ put on

3:28 There is @L Jew nor Greek, @ is @L bond nor free,

3:29 And if ye be @j's, @J are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs

4:1 Now I say, @« the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth

4:8 Howbeit @J, @ ye knew not God, ye did service @ @ @	
by nature are no gods.

4:9 But now, @. @ ye @ @Rn God, or rather are @Rn of God,

4:11 I am afraid of you, lest I @ bestowed @ you labour in vain.

4:12 Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye @

4:13 Ye @R how @á infirmity of the @ô I preached the gospel

4:14 And my temptation @	 was in my @ô ye despised not, nor

4:15 Where is @J the blessedness ye @g of? for I bear you record,

4:16 Am I @I be@ @ enemy, @4 I tell you the truth?
4:17 @† zealously affect you, but not well; yea, @ @ê exclude

4:21 Tell me, ye @ desire to be @ß the law, do ye not @ì the

bondmaid, the @Ñ by a free@µ.

4:23 But he who was of the bond@µ was born @. the @ô; but he
of the free@µ was by promise.

4:24 Which @, are an allegory: for @6 are the two @‡s;
the one @ the mount Sinai, @	 gendereth to bondage, @	 is
Agar.

4:25 For @ Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and ans@th to
@H @	 now is, and is in bondage @ her @.

4:26 But @H @	 is above is free, @	 is the @‘ of us

4:27 For it is written, Rejoice, @ barren @ bearest not; break
@? and cry, @ @ travailest not: for the desolate @ @s
@X @ @} she @	 @ an husband.

4:28 Now we, @l, as Isaac was, are the @ of promise.

4:29 But as @J he @ was born @. the @ô persecuted him @
was born @. the Spirit, @) so it is now.

4:30 N@Åtheless @\ @* the scripture? Cast out the bond@µ and
her son: for the son of the bond@µ @ not be heir @ the son
of the free@µ.

4:31 So @J, @l, we are not @ of the bond@µ, but of
the free.

5:1 Stand fast @I in the liberty @Œ@ @j @ @% us
free, and be not entangled @^ @ the yoke of bondage.

5:2 @e, I Paul say @ you, @ if ye be circumcised, @j

5:3 For I testify @^ to @+ man @ is circumcised, @ he is a

5:4 @j is be@ of no effect @ you, whoso@Å of you are

5:5 For we @á the Spirit wait for the hope of @€ by

5:6 For in @8 @j @L circumcision availeth any @q, nor

5:7 Ye did run well; who did hinder you @ ye @M not obey the

5:9 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.

5:11 And I, @l, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet

5:12 I @ê @ @ @) cut off @	 trouble you.

5:13 For, @l, ye @ @À @` @ liberty; only use not

5:14 For all the law is fulfilled in one @W, @) in @; @h

5:15 But if ye bite and devour one @à, @U heed @ ye be not

5:16 @Ã I say @J, Walk in the Spirit, and ye @ not fulfil the

5:17 For the @ô lusteth @" the Spirit, and the Spirit @"

5:18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not @ß the law.

5:19 Now the @ös of the @ô are manifest, @	 are @6;
Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 5:20 Idolatry,

5:25 If we live in the Spirit, let us @! walk in the Spirit.

5:26 Let us not be desirous of vain @•, provo@ one @à,

6:1 Brethren, if a man be @5@√ in a fault, ye @	 are

6:2 Bear ye one @à's burdens, and so fulfil the law of @j.

6:3 For if a man think @t to be some@q, @ he is no@q, he

6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for @\so@Å a man soweth,

6:10 As we @ @I opportunity, let us do @V @ all men,
